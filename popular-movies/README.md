   - original title
   - movie poster image - background poster
   - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
   - user rating (called vote_average in the api)

   - original language
   
## What Will I Learn After Stage 1?
You will fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
You will use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
You will incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write
